This guide assumes that you have completed the initial Aura tutorial in EVE Online, but haven't yet talked to any Career Agents.
**If you haven't finished the tutorial with Aura yet, go do that first.**

If you run into a problem during the tutorial, you can check if it's addressed in the [Rookie FAQ](/reference/rookie-faq).

Once you've finished the in-game tutorial you'll be ready to dive into [Fitting a Rookie Ship](/rookie-fitting/).
