### Weapons

The Executioner uses 3 `Small Focused Pulse Laser I` turrets.
Pulse lasers are the "short-ranged" laser system, dealing more damage with better tracking
than the longer-ranged beam lasers.

The pulse lasers are each loaded with a single `Multifrequency S` crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so you will only need to buy three.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.
Since you're going to be fighting at close range anyway, more damage is good.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Heat Sink I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its lasers.

### Defenses

This fit uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your lasers apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

The starter fit does not use or require any rigs.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 2500m, applying your web to slow them down.

Your ship has high speed, but is relatively fragile.  Keep an eye on your hitpoints,
and consider warping out or pulling range from the enemy guns if your armor repairer
cannot keep up with incoming damage.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118458/svg/118458-starter-executioner.svg?privatetoken=8882447389848240128"><a href="https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118458/8882447389848240128">View *Starter Executioner on Osmium</a></object>

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV

The improved fit uses a `5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive` rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, 
and causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.

This fit adds a `Small Ancillary Current Router I` to compensate
for the increased Powergrid requirement of the Microwarpdrive.

It also adds two `Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I` to increase the
effectiveness and efficiency of your Armor Repairer.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 3x `Small Focused Anode Pulse Particle Stream I`
 * Web: `Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier`
 * Injector: `Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
