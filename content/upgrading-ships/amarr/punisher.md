### Weapons

The Punisher uses 4 `Small Focused Pulse Laser I` turrets.
Pulse lasers are the "short-ranged" laser system, dealing more damage with better tracking
than the longer-ranged beam lasers.

The pulse lasers are each loaded with a single `Multifrequency S` crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so you will only need to buy four.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.
Since you're going to be fighting at close range anyway, more damage is good.

### Defenses

The Punisher's ample lowslots and armor resistance bonus make it a natural fit for armor tanking.
It fits a `400mm Steel Plates I` to give it additional raw armor HP,
and a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` and `Adaptive Nano Plating I` in its low slots 
to increase its resistance to damage.

In general, it is frowned upon to mix "buffer-tank" modules like the armor plate 
and "active-tank" modules like the armor repairer.  In this case,
the goal of the fit is to give you a feel for the sturdiness of the Punisher with the plate
while still allowing ample longevity for long missions with the armor repairer.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your lasers apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

The `Micro Auxiliary Power Core I` provides your ship with additional Powergrid.
This does not provide any direct combat benefit, but offers more room for the fitting
of Powergrid-hungry modules such as the armor plate.

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

A `Small Energy Collision Accelerator I` rig will give your energy turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 2500m, applying your web to slow them down.

You have a great deal of HP, but you do not have the capacitor to 
run your armor repairer indefinitely; try to keep an eye on your capacitor,
and keep it above 25%.  Your ship will sound an audio alert if your capacitor is getting low.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV

The most substantial change in this fit is the use of a `Small Ancillary Current Router I` rig
to improve powergrid, rather than the Micro Auxiliary Power Core. 
While relatively expensive, using the rig frees up a low slot, 
allowing us to fit a Heat Sink for more damage.

Additionally, the fits adds two `Small Trimark Armor Pump I` for additional armor HP,
though they will make the ship substantially slower.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 4x `Small Focused Anode Pulse Particle Stream I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner`
 * Web: `Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier`
 * Plate: `400mm Rolled Tungsten Compact Plates`
 * Resists: `'Refuge' Adaptive Nano Plating I`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Heat Sink II`
