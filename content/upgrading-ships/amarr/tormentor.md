    Cap Booster 200 x11
    Multifrequency S x3

### Weapons

The Tormentor uses 3 `Small Focused Pulse Laser I` turrets.
Pulse lasers are the "short-ranged" laser system, dealing more damage with better tracking
than the longer-ranged beam lasers.

The pulse lasers are each loaded with a single `Multifrequency S` crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so you will only need to buy three.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.
Since you're going to be fighting at close range anyway, more damage is good.

The Tormentor also includes two `Hobgoblin I` and two `Acolyte I` combat drones.
Remember to recall your drones before warping, or if they begin taking damage from enemy fire.

{{% notice info %}}
To use the combat drones, you will need to train the skills `Drones` III and `Light Drone Operation` I.
We recommend you use some of the skill points from the Mini Skill Injector
given in the tutorial to train these skills, as they will be useful in many ships.
You will need to purchase a skillbook from the Market to learn Light Drone Operation.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Heat Sink I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its lasers.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` and an `Adaptive Nano Plating I` in its low slots
to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your lasers apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

A `Small Energy Collision Accelerator I` rig will give your energy turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 2500m, applying your web to slow them down.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Tormentor, Tormentor alpha+]

    Small Focused Anode Pulse Particle Stream I
    Small Focused Anode Pulse Particle Stream I
    Small Focused Anode Pulse Particle Stream I

    1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
    Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier
    Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I

    Heat Sink II
    Small Armor Repairer II
    Damage Control II
    'Refuge' Adaptive Nano Plating I

    Small Energy Collision Accelerator I
    Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I
    Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I

    Warrior I x2
    Hobgoblin I x2

    Cap Booster 200 x11
    Multifrequency S x3

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Drones` Level III
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I

The improved fit adds two `Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I` to increase the
effectiveness and efficiency of your Armor Repairer.

Once you have the skills to use them, you should fill your Drone Bay with Combat Drones.
`Hobgoblin I` drones have the most damage output, while `Warrior I` drones have the most speed.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 3x `Small Focused Anode Pulse Particle Stream I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner`
 * Web: `Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier`
 * Injector: `Small F-RX Compact Capacitor Booster`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Heat Sink II`
 * Resists: `'Refuge' Adaptive Nano Plating I`
