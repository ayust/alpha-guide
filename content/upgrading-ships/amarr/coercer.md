### Weapons

The Coercer uses 8 `Dual Light Beam Laser I` turrets.
Beam lasers are the "long-ranged" laser system, dealing damage at longer ranges
than Pulse Lasers, but with worse tracking and slightly lower damage.

The beam lasers are each loaded with a single `Multifrequency S` crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so you will only need to buy eight.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Heat Sink I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its lasers.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 30-40).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

A `Small Energy Collision Accelerator I` rig will give your energy turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

A `Small Energy Burst Aerator I` rig will give your energy turrets a quicker rate of fire,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a mid-range fit.  Try to hang back from your targets
at a range of about 7500m, locking and destroying them in quick succession.
If targets are getting closer than that, use your Afterburner
to pull back to a longer range.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Coercer, Coercer alpha+]
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I

    1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
    Cap Recharger II


    Heat Sink II
    Small Armor Repairer II
    Damage Control II

    Small Capacitor Control Circuit I
    Small Capacitor Control Circuit I
    Small Capacitor Control Circuit I

    Multifrequency S x8

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level III

The Coercer's eight laser turrets make it extremely capacitor-hungry.
Its bonus to laser capacitor consumption means you can substantially improve your
capacitor life by training Amarr Destroyer to level III or IV.

The largest change to the improved fit is the loss of the Capacitor Booster,
so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend
as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.

To compensate for the loss of the Capacitor Booster, the ship mounts a `Cap Recharger II`,
and replaces the rigs with three `Small Capacitor Control Circuit I`, enhancing
its passive capacitor recharge.  Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try
not to let it dip below 25%.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 8x `Dual Modulated Light Energy Beam I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Heat Sink II`
