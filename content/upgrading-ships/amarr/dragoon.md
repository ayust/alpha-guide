{{% notice info %}}
This is a drone ship.  You will need to train at least **`Drones` Level III**
and **`Light Drone Operation` Level I** before you will be able to use its primary armament.
{{% /notice %}}

### Weapons

The Dragoon's primary armament is its flight of up to five Combat Drones.
`Hobgoblin I` drones deal the most damage, while `Warrior I` drones have the highest speed.
To fill your drone bay, you should acquire fifteen light combat drones.

Additionally, it uses 3 `Small Focused Pulse Laser I` turrets as a secondary weapon.
Pulse lasers are the "short-ranged" laser system, dealing more damage with better tracking
than the longer-ranged beam lasers.

The pulse lasers are each loaded with a single `Multifrequency S` crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so you will only need to buy three.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.
Since you're going to be fighting at close range anyway, more damage is good.

Additionally, this fit uses two `Drone Damage Amplifier I` in its low slots.
These passively increase the damage output of its drones.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 30-40).

The `Salvager I` allows you to salvage any Wrecks you come across for valuable materials.
While you should not delay combat to stop and salvage wrecks without a more specialized salvage ship,
it can provide some side income by salvaging wrecks while your drones continue engaging targets.

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

Three `Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I` rigs increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your Armor Repairer.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a droneboat fit.  Let your drones fly in from long range and destroy
the targets while you remain safely out of harm's way.  Use your lasers on enemies
that slip past the drones and get close to you, at about 2500m range.  Keep an eye on your drones' HP,
and command them to return to your drone bay if they're taking enemy fire.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Dragoon, Dragoon alpha+]

    Dual Modulated Pulse Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Pulse Energy Beam I
    Dual Modulated Pulse Energy Beam I
    Drone Link Augmentor I
    Small Ghoul Compact Energy Nosferatu

    1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
    Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier

    Drone Damage Amplifier II
    'Refuge' Adaptive Nano Plating I
    Small Armor Repairer II
    Damage Control II

    Small Capacitor Control Circuit I
    Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I
    Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I

    Hobgoblin I x15

    Multifrequency S x3

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Capacitor Emission Systems` Level I
* `Drone Avionics` Level III
* `Drones` Level V
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I

Your character starts with very low drone skills.  If you intend to continue
using drone ships, we recommend focusing your training on some 
[drone support skills](/training/combat/#drone-combat-skills).
{{% /notice %}}

The largest change to the improved fit is the loss of the Capacitor Booster,
so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend
as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.

In place of the Capacitor Booster, it fits a `Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier`
to slow down nearby targets for its lasers.  One of the rigs is replaced with a
`Small Capacitor Control Circuit I` to help compensate.

Additionally, with improved skills, the options for the utility highslots are expanded.
The improved fit replaces the Salvager with a `Drone Link Augmentor I`, letting you command
your drones at substantially longer range (in this case, to the ship's maximum lockrange).

It also adds a `Small Ghoul Compact Energy Nosferatu`, which can be used to drain capacitor
from enemy ships and add to your own, if your capacitor is strained by your repair module.

The additional CPU cost of these modules requires us to replace one of the Drone Damage Amplifiers
with a `'Refuge' Adaptive Nano Plating I`, offering additional armor resistance.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 3x `Dual Modulated Pulse Energy Beam I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Drone Damage Amplifier II`
