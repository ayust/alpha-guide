{{% notice info %}}
This is a drone ship.  You will need to train at least **`Drones` Level III**
and **`Light Drone Operation` Level I** before you will be able to use its primary armament.
{{% /notice %}}

### Weapons

The Algos's primary armament is its flight of up to five Combat Drones.
`Hobgoblin I` drones deal the most damage, while `Warrior I` drones have the highest speed.
To fill your drone bay, you should acquire a total of twelve light combat drones.

Additionally, it uses 5 `Light Ion Blaster I` turrets as a secondary weapon,
and for additional damage output against larger targets.
Blasters are the "short-ranged" hybrid system, with some of the highest damage output 
and best tracking against small targets in the game.  In exchange, they are the shortest-ranged
weapon system in the game, being all but useless outside of point-blank range.

The blasters are loaded with `Antimatter Charge S` ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
As blasters require you to be in knife-fighting range anyway,
losing a few more meters will hardly be noticed,
and the extra damage will be appreciated once you come to grips with your foe.
You should keep about 2000 spare rounds in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Drone Damage Amplifier I` in one of its low slots.
These passively increase the damage output of its drones.

It also uses a `Magnetic Field Stabilizer I` in one of its low slots.
These passively increase the damage output of its blasters.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 30-40).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

This fit uses two `Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I` and one `Small Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I`
to increase its shields' damage resistance.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a droneboat fit.  Let your drones fly in from long range and destroy
the targets while you remain safely out of harm's way.  Use your blasters on enemies
that slip past the drones and get close to you, at about 500m range, or close in
to apply their damage to larger and more durable targets.  Keep an eye on your drones' HP,
and command them to return to your drone bay if they're taking enemy fire.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118668/svg/118668-alpha-clone---improved-algos.svg?privatetoken=897549341961486336"><a href="https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118668/897549341961486336">View Alpha Clone - Improved Algos on Osmium</a></object>

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level III
* `Shield Operation` Level III
* `Drones` Level V
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I
* `Medium Drone Operation` Level I

{{% notice info %}}
Your character starts with very low drone skills.  If you intend to continue
using drone ships, we recommend focusing your training on some 
[drone support skills](/training/combat/#drone-combat-skills).

Once you have trained Medium Drone Operation, you have the option of using the larger Medium Combat Drones,
such as the high-damage `Hammerhead I` or the faster `Valkyrie I`.  These drones will have trouble
applying their damage to smaller targets, and should be used against cruiser-sized targets and larger.

You should then load your drone bay with two sets of drones: a "maximum damage" set of
two medium drones and three light drones, for applying damage to large targets,
and a separate set of five light drones, for quickly clearing out smaller ships.

The largest change to the improved fit is the loss of the Capacitor Booster,
so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend
as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.

To compensate for the loss of the Capacitor Booster, the ship mounts a `Cap Recharger II`,
and replaces the Anti-Thermal and one of the Anti-EM rigs with two `Small Capacitor Control Circuit I`, enhancing its passive capacitor recharge.  Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try
not to let it dip below 25%.

It also swaps the Magnetic Field Stabilizer for a second Drone Damage Amplifier,
as by the time you have the skills to fly the Improved fit, your Drone skills should have improved
to the point where they will be substantially more effective and you will need
to rely on your blasters less often.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 5x `Modal Light Ion Particle Accelerator I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Shield Booster: `Small Shield Booster II`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Damage Mods: 2x `Drone Damage Amplifier II`
