{{% notice info %}}
This is a drone ship.  You will need to train at least **`Drones` Level III**
and **`Light Drone Operation` Level I** before you will be able to use its primary armament.
{{% /notice %}}

### Weapons

The Tristan's primary armament is its flight of up to five Combat Drones.
`Hobgoblin I` drones deal the most damage, while `Warrior I` drones have the highest speed.
To fill your drone bay, you should acquire a total of eight light combat drones.

Additionally, it uses 2 `Light Neutron Blaster I` turrets as a secondary weapon.
Blasters are the "short-ranged" hybrid system, with some of the highest damage output 
and best tracking against small targets in the game.  In exchange, they are the shortest-ranged
weapon system in the game, being all but useless outside of point-blank range.

The blasters are loaded with `Antimatter Charge S` ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
As blasters require you to be in knife-fighting range anyway,
losing a few more meters will hardly be noticed,
and the extra damage will be appreciated once you come to grips with your foe.
You should keep about 1000 spare rounds in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Drone Damage Amplifier I` in one of its low slots.
These passively increase the damage output of its drones.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

A `Small Hybrid Collision Accelerator I` rig will give your hybrid turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a droneboat fit.  Let your drones fly in from long range and destroy
the targets while you remain safely out of harm's way.  Use your blasters on enemies
that slip past the drones and get close to you, at about 500m range.  Keep an eye on your drones' HP,
and command them to return to your drone bay if they're taking enemy fire.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Drones` Level V
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I

Your character starts with very low drone skills.  If you intend to continue
using drone ships, we recommend focusing your training on some 
[drone support skills](/training/combat/#drone-combat-skills).

The improved fit replaces the weapon rig with a `Small Anti-Explosive Pump I`,
to patch the weak spot in its armor's resistance profile, and two `Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I`,
to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its armor repairer.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 2x `Anode Light Neutron Particle Cannon I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Web: `X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier`
 * Injector: `Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Drone Damage Amplifier II`
