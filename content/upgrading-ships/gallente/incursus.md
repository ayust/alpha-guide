    1MN Afterburner I
    Stasis Webifier I
    Small Capacitor Booster I

    Hobgoblin I x1

    Cap Booster 200 x11
    Antimatter Charge S x2240

### Weapons

The Incursus uses 3 `Light Neutron Blaster I` turrets.
Blasters are the "short-ranged" hybrid system, with some of the highest damage output 
and best tracking against small targets in the game.  In exchange, they are the shortest-ranged
weapon system in the game, being all but useless outside of point-blank range.

The blasters are loaded with `Antimatter Charge S` ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
As blasters require you to be in knife-fighting range anyway,
losing a few more meters will hardly be noticed,
and the extra damage will be appreciated once you come to grips with your foe.
You should keep about 2000 spare rounds in your cargohold.

The Incursus also includes one `Hobgoblin I` combat drone.
Remember to recall your drone before warping, or if they begin taking damage from enemy fire.

{{% notice info %}}
To use the combat drone, you will need to train the skills `Drones` III and `Light Drone Operation` I.
We recommend you use some of the skill points from the Mini Skill Injector
given in the tutorial to train these skills, as they will be useful in many ships.
You will need to purchase a skillbook from the Market to learn Light Drone Operation.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Magnetic Field Stabilizer I` in one of its low slots.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its blasters.

### Defenses

This ship uses two `Small Armor Repairer I` in it low slots to repair incoming damage.
Using one at a time will be sufficient for most situations, but both can be activated
simultaneously when incoming damage is high.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your projectiles apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

The starter fit does not use or require any rigs.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 500m, applying your web to slow them down.
If having difficulty hitting small targets, you can try turning off your Afterburner,
or using the Keep At Range command rather than orbiting, though the damage you take will increase as well.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Incursus, Incursus alpha+]

    Anode Light Neutron Particle Cannon I
    Anode Light Neutron Particle Cannon I
    Anode Light Neutron Particle Cannon I

    1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
    Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier
    Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I

    Magnetic Field Stabilizer II
    Small Armor Repairer II
    Damage Control II

    Small Explosive Armor Reinforcer I
    Small Thermal Armor Reinforcer I
    Small Kinetic Armor Reinforcer I

    Hobgoblin I x1

    Cap Booster 200 x11
    Antimatter Charge S x2240

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Drones` Level III
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I

Once you have the skills to use them, you should fill your Drone Bay with a Combat Drone.
`Hobgoblin I` drones have the most damage output, while `Warrior I` drones have the most speed.

The improved fit adds a `Small Explosive Armor Reinforcer I`,
to patch the weak spot in its armor's resistance profile, as well as a
`Small Thermal Armor Reinforcer I` and a `Small Kinetic Armor Reinforcer I`,
to improve its armor resistances against damage types commonly faced in Gallente space.

This kind of fit would commonly use Auxiliary Nano Pump rigs, to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of its armor repairer, but has insufficient powergrid to make use of them here.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 3x `Anode Light Neutron Particle Cannon I`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner`
 * Web: `Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier`
 * Injector: `Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: 2x `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Magnetic Field Stabilizer II`
