Over the course of your Career Agent missions, 
they will have given you some of the following ships.
They are more powerful than your rookie ship.
They are also more specialized, and each ship is built for a specific purpose.

### Frigates

Frigates are some of the fastest and smallest ships in New Eden.
This makes them very difficult for larger ships to hit.
Their guns also track very quickly, allowing them to effectively fight other frigates.
However, their raw defensive and offensive power is relatively weak.

##### Atron

The Atron is the Gallente fast-attack frigate.
It is extremely quick, and packs a decent punch.
Its bonus to the capacitor cost of Propulsion Jamming modules 
also makes it good at "tackling" enemy ships, holding them in place.
However, it is relatively fragile.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Atron.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/atron/)

##### Tristan

The Tristan is the Gallente heavy attack frigate.
As a drone platform, it is unrivalled among tech one frigates,
capable of fielding a full flight of five light drones, with three spares
in its spacious drone bay.  It is also fairly well-rounded otherwise,
with moderate damage output from its turrets and decent speed and utility options.
However, it is somewhat lightly defended.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Tristan.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/tristan/)

##### Incursus

The Incursus is the Gallente heavy combat frigate.
Its bonuses to armor repairers let it shrug off a great deal of incoming damage, 
and it has good firepower and decent utility options.
However, it is fairly slow.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Incursus.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/incursus/)

##### Imicus

The Imicus is the Gallente exploration frigate.
It has substantial bonuses to the use of scanner probes and relic/data analyzers,
making it a powerful option for exploration-minded capsuleers.
However, it is fragile, and weak in direct combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Imicus.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/imicus/)

##### Navitas

The Navitas is the Gallente logistics frigate.
It has potent bonuses to remote armor repair modules,
allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle.
However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Navitas for now.

##### Maulus

The Maulus is the Gallente electronic warfare frigate.
It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of sensor dampener modules,
allowing it to interfere with the locking speed and range of its enemies' sensors from long range.
However, it is extremely fragile, and is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Maulus for now.

##### Venture

The Venture is a mining frigate, not specific to any one empire.
It has powerful bonuses to its mining lasers and gas harvesters,
as well as a vast ore hold, allowing it to accumulate massive amounts of raw resources.
It also has innate resistance to warp disruption, allowing it to escape attackers more easily.
However, it is not particularly suitable for combat.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Venture.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/venture/)

### Destroyers

Destroyers are designed as a counter to frigates.
They are "glass cannons" - they get large numbers of frigate-class guns,
with substantial enhancements to their range and tracking,
making them able to swat frigates out of the sky with ease.
However,  their defenses are little stronger than a frigate's,
and their larger size and slower speed makes them less able to avoid the fire
of larger ships.  They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output. 

##### Catalyst

The Catalyst is one of the Gallente destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets.
With the maximum of eight hardpoints for hybrid weapons,
and with potent bonuses to their range and accuracy,
it will quickly destroy any smaller enemies that come within range of its guns.
However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit.
Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons' damage output.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Catalyst.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/catalyst/)

##### Algos

The Algos is the other Gallente destroyer, focusing on drones.
It gets only five turret hardpoints, few for a destroyer,
but has the drone bandwidth to begin mixing in medium drones
into its flights, with room in its bay for a spare flight of lights.
It also has moderate speed and defenses, and works well with shield-tanking modules.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Algos.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/algos/)

### Cruisers

Cruisers, as a class, are the most well-rounded ships in New Eden.  With comfortable slot layouts,
decent firepower, good defenses, moderate speed, and moderate price,
they're the standard by which other ships are measured.  

Cruiser fittings will not be provided in this guide.  By the time you're getting
into a cruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see
[Fitting](/reference/fitting/) if you need some pointers.

### Battlecruisers

Battlecruisers are to cruisers as destroyers are to frigates:
much more heavily armed, but substantially slower.  Battlecruisers are
also significantly better defended, yet also more expensive.

Under the old alpha clone rules the only battlecruiser that alpha clones could
use was the `Gnosis`. however, since December 2017 (EVE Vegas) alpha clones can
now fly up to a battleship.

### Industrials

Industrials, as class, are non-combat ships focused on the transport of goods across New Eden.
They have massive cargo holds, but are slow, clumsy, and poorly armed at best - if they're armed at all.
They can be a great boon to a marketeer, industrialist, 
or even a combat pilot restocking on gear or moving locations,
but are borderline useless in combat and a favorite target of player pirates.

##### Nereus

The Nereus is one of the Gallente industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place.
It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks
long enough for reinforcements to arrive.
However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.
