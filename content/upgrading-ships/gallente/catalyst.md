### Weapons

The Catalyst uses 8 `125mm Railgun I` turrets.
Railguns are the "long-ranged" hybrid system, with some of the longest firing ranges in the game,
compared to the extremely short-ranged Blasters.  In exchange, they deal less damage over time,
are harder to fit, and have very poor tracking against close-in targets.

The railguns are loaded with `Antimatter Charge S` ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
The base range of your railguns will allow you to easily outrange your enemies
even with this short-ranged ammo, so more damage is always nice.
You should keep about 2500 spare rounds in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Magnetic Field Stabilizer I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its railguns.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of it low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your projectiles apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay at the proper range from the slower enemies.)

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

A `Small Hybrid Collision Accelerator I` rig will give your hybrid turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a mid-range fit.  Try to hang back from your targets
at a range of about 7500m, locking and destroying them in quick succession.
If targets are getting closer than that, use your Afterburner
to pull back to a longer range.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV

The improved fit uses a `5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive` rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, 
and causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.

The improved fit replaces the weapon rig with a `Small Anti-Explosive Pump I`, to patch the weak point
in its armor's resist profile.

It also adds two `Small Capacitor Control Circuit I` rigs, passively increasing its capacitor regeneration
and allowing the armor repairer to be run for longer periods.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 8x `125mm Prototype Gauss Gun`
 * Web: `X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Magnetic Field Stabilizer II`
