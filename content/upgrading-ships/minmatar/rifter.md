### Importable Fit
    [Rifter, Rifter alpha]

    200mm AutoCannon I
    200mm AutoCannon I
    200mm AutoCannon I

    1MN Afterburner I
    Stasis Webifier I
    Small Capacitor Booster I

    Gyrostabilizer I
    Small Armor Repairer I
    Damage Control I

    Small Projectile Collision Accelerator I
    Small Projectile Burst Aerator I

    Cap Booster 200 x11
    Fusion S x2360

### Weapons

The Rifter uses 3 `200mm Autocannon I` turrets.
Autocannons are the "short-ranged" projectile system, dealing more damage with better tracking
than the longer-ranged artillery cannons.  They also fire much more rapidly.

The autocannons are loaded with `Fusion S` ammunition.
Fusion is one of the three short-range, high-damage ammunition types,
and its Explosive damage is well-suited to defeating the Angel pirates
most commonly encountered in Minmatar space.
Since you're going to be fighting at close range anyway, more damage is good.
You should keep about 2000 spare rounds in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Gyrostabilizer I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its autocannons.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your projectiles apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

A `Small Projectile Collision Accelerator I` rig will give your projectile turrets additional damage output,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

A `Small Projectile Burst Aerator I` rig will give your projectile turrets a quicker rate of fire,
though it also increases the Powergrid usage of your guns.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 1000m, applying your web to slow them down.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Rifter, Rifter alpha+]

    200mm Light 'Scout' Autocannon I
    200mm Light 'Scout' Autocannon I
    200mm Light 'Scout' Autocannon I

    5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
    X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier
    Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I

    Gyrostabilizer II
    Small Armor Repairer II
    Damage Control II

    Small Explosive Armor Reinforcer I
    Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I
    Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I

    Cap Booster 200 x11
    Fusion S x2360

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV

The improved fit uses a `5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive` rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, 
and causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.

The improved fit replaces the weapon rigs with a `Small Explosive Armor Reinforcer I`
to bolster the armor's weak explosive resistance, and two `Small Auxiliary Nano Pump I`
to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the armor repairer.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 3x `200mm Light 'Scout' Autocannon I`
 * Web: `X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier`
 * Injector: `Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Armor Repairer: `Small Armor Repairer II`
 * Damage Mod: `Gyrostabilizer II`
