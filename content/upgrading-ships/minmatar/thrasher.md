### Weapons

The Thrasher uses 7 `200mm Autocannon I` turrets.
Autocannons are the "short-ranged" projectile system, dealing more damage with better tracking
than the longer-ranged artillery cannons.  They also fire much more rapidly.

The autocannons are loaded with `Fusion S` ammunition.
Fusion is one of the three short-range, high-damage ammunition types,
and its Explosive damage is well-suited to defeating the Angel pirates
most commonly encountered in Minmatar space.
Since you're going to be fighting at close range anyway, more damage is good.
You should keep about 5000 spare rounds in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Gyrostabilizer I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its autocannons.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Medium Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.
The capacitor consumption of this module is very high, so it should be used sparingly.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

This ship is fit with a `Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I` rig to plug
the weak spot in its shields' resistance profile.

It is also fit with two `Small Core Defense Capacitor Safeguard I` rigs,
which lower the cost of the Shield Booster, allowing its use to be maintained for longer.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 1000m.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Shield Operation` Level III

The improved fit uses a `5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive` rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, 
and causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 7x `200mm Light Prototype Automatic Cannon`
 * Injector: `Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I`
 * Shield Booster: `Medium Shield Booster II`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Damage Mod: `Gyrostabilizer II`
