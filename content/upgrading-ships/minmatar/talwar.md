{{% notice info %}}
This is a missile ship.  You will need to train at least **`Missile Launcher Operation` Level II**
and `Light Missiles` Level I before you will be able to use its weapons.
{{% /notice %}}

### Weapons

The Talwar uses 7 `Light Missile Launcher I` launchers.
Light Missiles are the "long-ranged" missile system, reaching to a much longer range
than Rockets and dealing more damage per strike, but firing much more slowly,
requiring more fitting space, and dealing less overall damage over time with poorer application to small targets.

The launchers are loaded with `Nova Light Missile` ammunition.
As the Talwar's bonus to missile damage applies only to Explosive damage
such as that dealt by Nova missiles, you should nearly always use this ammunition.
Additionally, its Explosive damage is well-suited to defeating the Angel pirates
most commonly encountered in Minmatar space.
You should keep about 1000 spare missiles in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Ballistic Control System I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its missiles.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

The `Nanofiber Internal Structure I` gives the ship additional speed and maneuverability.
It thus makes it easier to stay at the appropriate range from your targets.
It is not a preferred option, but the missile launchers' strain on the ship's Powergrid
prevent fitting more powerful choices.

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

This ship is fit with one `Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I` rig
and one `Small Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I` rig, to improve the shields' resistance to damage.

It is also fit with a `Small Processor Overclocking Unit I` rig,
to improve the ship's CPU.  Without this rig, it cannot bring all the modules in the fit
online simultaneously.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a long-range sniping fit.  Stay at range from your targets,
ideally about 20-25km, and lob missiles at them from out of range of their return fire.
The fit is rather fragile, and is not designed to tank incoming fire for extended periods;
if you are being overwhelmed, retreat to range and pick off pursuers one by one.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Shield Operation` Level III
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level III

Your character starts with very low missile skills.  If you intend to continue
using missile ships, we recommend focusing your training on some 
[missile support skills](/training/combat/#missile-skills).

The improved fit uses a `5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive` rather than an Afterburner.
An MWD takes a large amount of capacitor to run, 
and causes a large increase to your ship's signature radius,
meaning that unlike the Afterburner, it is not useful for evading enemy fire.
However, it provides a massively increased speed bonus.

You should activate the MWD only when moving to a new position or enemy,
and disable it once you have arrived.

The improved fit removes the Capacitor Booster, so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.

To compensate for the loss of the Capacitor Booster, the ship mounts a `Cap Recharger II`,
and replaces the anti-Thermal rig with a `Small Capacitor Control Circuit I`, enhancing
its passive capacitor recharge.  Remember that this fit is designed to outrange its enemies,
and should use its shield booster sparingly.  Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try
not to let it dip below 25%.

This fit replaces the Nanofiber Internal Structure with a `Mark I Compact Power Diagnostic System`,
offering small bonuses to its shield, capacitor, and powergrid.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 7x `Arbalest Compact Light Missile Launcher`
 * Shield Booster: `Small Shield Booster II`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Damage Mod: `Ballistic Control System II`
