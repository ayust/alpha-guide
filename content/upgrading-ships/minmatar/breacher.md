{{% notice info %}}
This is a missile ship.  You will need to train at least **`Rockets` Level I** 
before you will be able to use its weapons.
{{% /notice %}}

### Weapons

The Breacher uses 3 `Rocket Launcher I` launchers.
Rockets are the "short-ranged" missile system, dealing more damage with better application to small ships
than the longer-ranged light missiles.  They also fire much more rapidly.

The launchers are loaded with `Nova Rocket` ammunition.
Its Explosive damage is well-suited to defeating the Angel pirates
most commonly encountered in Minmatar space.
You should keep about 1000 spare rockets in your cargohold.

The Breacher also includes two `Warrior I` combat drones.
Remember to recall your drone before warping, or if they begin taking damage from enemy fire.

{{% notice info %}}
To use the combat drones, you will need to train the skills `Drones` III and `Light Drone Operation` I.
We recommend you use some of the skill points from the Mini Skill Injector
given in the tutorial to train these skills, as they will be useful in many ships.
You will need to purchase a skillbook from the Market to learn Light Drone Operation.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Ballistic Control System I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its rockets.

It also fits a `Missile Guidance Enhancer I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the range and precision of its rockets.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Medium Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.
The capacitor consumption of this module is very high, so it should be used sparingly.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your rockets apply their damage better. 
(It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 10).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

This ship is fit with two `Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I` rigs 
and one `Small Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I` rig, to improve the shields' resistance to damage.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 500m, applying your web to slow them down.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://o.smium.org/api/convert/118527/svg/118527-alpha-clone---improved-breacher.svg?privatetoken=5891712325630558208"><a href="https://o.smium.org/loadout/private/118527/5891712325630558208">View Alpha Clone - Improved Breacher on Osmium</a></object>

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Rockets` Level I
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Drones` Level III
* `Light Drone Operation` Level I

{{% notice info %}}
Your character starts with very low missile skills.  If you intend to continue
using missile ships, we recommend focusing your training on some 
[missile support skills](/training/combat/#missile-skills).
{{% /notice %}}

Once you have the skills to use them, you should fill your Drone Bay with Combat Drones.
`Hobgoblin I` drones have the most damage output, while `Warrior I` drones have the most speed.

The improved fit replaces the anti-Thermal rig and one anti-EM rig with two 
`Small Core Defense Capacitor Safeguard I`.  These reduce the capacitor cost
of running the shield booster, allowing its use to be sustained for longer.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Launchers: 3x `'Arbalest' Rocket Launcher I`
 * Web: `X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier`
 * Injector: `Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I`
 * Shield Booster: `Medium Clarity Ward Booster I`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Damage Mod: `Ballistic Control System II`
 * Damage Application Mod: `Missile Guidance Enhancer II`
