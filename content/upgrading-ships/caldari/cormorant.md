### Weapons

The Cormorant uses 7 `125mm Railgun I` turrets.
Railguns are the "long-ranged" hybrid system, with some of the longest firing ranges in the game,
compared to the extremely short-ranged Blasters.  In exchange, they deal less damage over time,
are harder to fit, and have very poor tracking against close-in targets.

The railguns are loaded with `Antimatter Charge S` ammunition.
Antimatter is the shortest-ranged basic hybrid charge, but does the most damage.
The base range of your railguns will allow you to easily outrange your enemies
even with this short-ranged ammo, so more damage is always nice.
You should keep about 2500 spare rounds in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Magnetic Field Stabilizer I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its railguns.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Medium Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.
The capacitor consumption of this module is very high, so it should be used sparingly.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Small Capacitor Booster I` can provide your ship with an instant injection of Capacitor.
This module must be fueled by charges, which act as consumable batteries.  Load it with 
`Cap Booster 200` bought from the market, and bring along as many spares as you can carry (about 30-50).

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

This ship is fit with two `Small EM Shield Reinforcer I` rigs and one
`Small Thermal Shield Reinforcer I` rig, to improve its shields' resistance to damage.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a mid-range fit.  Try to hang back from your targets
at a range of about 7500m to 10000m, locking and destroying them in quick succession.
If targets are getting closer than that, use your Afterburner
to pull back to a longer range.

This ship has a Capacitor Booster.  As the charges for it are quite bulky,
you can carry only a limited number.  Try to save the Booster charges for emergencies
when you need the extra capacitor to run your repair module continuously. 
Under normal circumstances, use your repper sparingly, off your ship's base capacitor.
Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try not to let it go below about 25%.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Cormorant, Cormorant alpha+]

    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun
    150mm Prototype Gauss Gun

    Small Shield Booster II
    1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
    Cap Recharger II

    Magnetic Field Stabilizer II
    Damage Control II

    Small EM Shield Reinforcer I
    Small Capacitor Control Circuit I
    Small Capacitor Control Circuit I

    Antimatter Charge S x2500

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level I

The largest change to the improved fit is the loss of the Capacitor Booster,
so that pilots are not required to restock on bulky Cap Booster charges or spend
as much manual effort on managing their capacitor.

To compensate for the loss of the Capacitor Booster, the ship mounts a `Cap Recharger II`,
and replaces the Anti-Thermal and one of the Anti-EM rigs with two `Small Capacitor Control Circuit I`, enhancing its passive capacitor recharge.  Keep an eye on your capacitor, and try
not to let it dip below 25%.

The shield booster has been downsized from Medium to a `Small Shield Booster II`.
This reduces the maximum "burst-tanking" power of its defense,
but allows the booster's use to be sustained for much longer.

The reduced fitting cost allows the use of more powerful and longer-ranged guns,
increasing its effective range to about 15-20km.  You can play the improved fit as
more of a true sniper, hanging back out of range of the enemy's return fire and
picking them off from afar.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Guns: 7x `150mm Prototype Gauss Gun`
 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Shield Booster: `Small Shield Booster II`
 * Damage Mod: `Magnetic Field Stabilizer II`
