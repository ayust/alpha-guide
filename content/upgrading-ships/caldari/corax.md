{{% notice info %}}
This is a missile ship.  You will need to train at least **`Rockets` Level I** before you will be able to use its weapons.
{{% /notice %}}

### Weapons

The Corax uses 7 `Rocket Launcher I` launchers.
Rockets are the "short-ranged" missile system, dealing more damage with better application to small ships
than the longer-ranged light missiles.  They also fire much more rapidly.

The rockets are loaded with `Scourge Rocket` ammunition.
As the Condor's bonus to missile damage applies only to Kinetic damage
such as that dealt by Scourge missiles, you should nearly always use this ammunition.
Additionally, its Kinetic damage is well-suited to defeating the Guristas pirates
most commonly encountered in Caldari space.
You should keep about 2000 spare rockets in your cargohold.

Additionally, this fit uses a `Ballistic Control System I` in a low slot.
This passively increases the damage output and rate of fire of its rockets.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Small Shield Booster I` in one of the mid slots to repair incoming damage.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` and an `EM Ward Amplifier I` to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your rockets apply their damage better. 
(It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

This ship is fit with one `Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I` rig, 
one `Small Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I` rig, 
and one `Small Anti-Kinetic Screen Reinforcer I` rig,
to improve the shields' resistance to damage.

### How To Fly

This is designed as a brawling fit.  Fly in close to your targets
and begin orbiting them at about 500m, applying your web to slow them down.

As always, if the incoming damage is proving too much for your ship
and you're beginning to take structure damage, warp out.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Weapon Upgrades` Level IV
* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Energy Grid Upgrades` Level III

Your character starts with very low missile skills.  If you intend to continue
using missile ships, we recommend focusing your training on some 
[missile support skills](/training/combat/#missile-skills).

The improved fit replaces the anti-Thermal and anti-Kinetic rigs
with two `Small Capacitor Control Circuit I` rigs, and the
EM Ward Amplifier with a `Cap Recharger II`.  These weaken
the ship's raw defenses, but allow its shield booster to be used almost continuously.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Propulsion: `1MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner`
 * Guns: 7x `'Arbalest' Rocket Launcher I`
 * Shield Booster: `Small Shield Booster II`
 * Web: `X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Damage Mod: `Ballistic Control System II`
