{{% notice info %}}
As industrial ships are intended for item transport rather than combat, this ship is **unarmed**.
If you find yourself forced into combat, your best option is to simply run away.

{{% notice warning %}}
Industrials are a favorite target of many players - and even in high-security space, where CONCORD will appear to punish illegal attacks, they will usually arrive *after* your attackers have reduced your ship to a flaming wreck.  Be mindful of your surroundings, and try to keep your cargo's value under about 20 million ISK.

### Hauling Enhancements

The lowslots are used for three `Expanded Cargohold I`, to further increase
the ship's cargo capacity and help it perform its primary function.
These increase its cargo bay from 4095 m3 to 6643 m3 - enough to carry 
two frigates or a destroyer, along with their fittings and ammunition.

### Defenses

This ship uses a `Large Shield Extender I` and a `Medium Shield Extender I` 
in its mid slots to grant it additional shield HP.

It also mounts two `EM Ward Amplifier I` and a `Thermal Dissipation Amplifier I`
to enhance its shield's damage resistance.

It also fits a `Damage Control I` in a low slot to increase its resistance to damage.

### Utility

The `10MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed.  (Note
that this is a cruiser-sized module, not the 1MN afterburners used on frigates and destroyers!)

### Rigs

Rigs are passive modifications to a ship, trading off one attribute against another.
Unlike modules, rigs cannot be removed without being destroyed. 
As a starter fit, this fit makes limited use of rigging, since many "optimal" rigs
are often relatively expensive and may be difficult to find near your starter station.

The starter fit does not use or require any rigs.

### How To Fly

The Badger is an industrial ship.  It should be primarily hauling goods from one
station to another, sticking to safe space and avoiding combat.

When moving between stations, you should always fly your Industrial directly from
gate to gate, and jump immediately upon landing.  Do not use your Autopilot,
as it will land you a substantial distance from the gate, making it easy for other players
to scan your cargo for valuables and plan a potential attack.

Industrials are very slow, and sluggish to get into warp.  To improve this, 
after clicking "Warp" on a destination, you can activate your Afterburner for a single cycle 
(click it so that it glows green, then immediately click it again so it glows red). 
The additional acceleration will help you get up to warp speed faster.
(Leaving the afterburner on will make it take longer, as the speed required
to enter warp is 75% of your *current* maximum speed.)

{{% notice warning %}}
You should not take an Industrial ship outside of high-security space (0.5 and up).
If you join a low-security, null-security or wormhole corporation and live in their space,
ask them for assistance if you need to do anything requiring an Industrial ship.

## Future Improvements

The above fit should be usable with starting skills unless otherwise noted,
and it uses relatively cheap and widely-available modules.  

As you accumulate skill points and ISK, you will be able to fit more potent
modules to your ship, increasing its effectiveness.  These modules may not be
readily available outside of trade hubs, but it can be worth the trip.

We recommend working towards the following improved fit:

    [Badger, Badger alpha+]

    Large Shield Extender II
    Medium Shield Extender II
    EM Shield Amplifier II
    Compact Multispectrum Shield Hardener
    Thermal Shield Amplifier II
    10MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner

    Expanded Cargohold II
    Expanded Cargohold II
    Expanded Cargohold II
    Damage Control II

    Medium Cargohold Optimization I
    Medium Cargohold Optimization I
    Medium Cargohold Optimization I

The improved fit will require the training of the following skills to use all installed equipment:

* `Hull Upgrades` Level IV
* `Shield Upgrades` Level IV

The improved fit replaces the shield resistance rigs with three `Medium Cargohold Optimization I`
for additional cargo capacity.  Combined with the upgrade to `Expanded Cargohold II` modules,
this increases its cargo bay to 12908.6 m3 - enough for five frigates, two destroyers, or a cruiser,
with room to spare for their fittings and ammunition.

It replaces one of the EM resistance modules with a `Limited Adaptive Invulnerability Field I`
for better across-the-board resistances.  Note that this module must be activated manually;
turn it on after each jump while travelling through highly-trafficked areas.

Nearly every module has been improved to a "meta" version, requiring less fitting space
and granting improved effectiveness, but costing more ISK and/or being less widely available,
or a t2 version, which costs more ISK, requires more skillpoints, and is harder to fit:

 * Propulsion: `10MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner`
 * Shield Extender: `Large Shield Extender II`
 * Shield Extender: `Medium Shield Extender II`
 * Resists: `EM Shield Amplifier II`
 * Resists: `Thermal Shield Amplifier II`
 * Damage Control: `Damage Control II`
 * Expanded Cargohold: 3x `Expanded Cargohold II`
