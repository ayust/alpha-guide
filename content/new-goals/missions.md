### What

Mission running is PvE content: getting missions from NPC agents
and then completing them for the mission rewards and the bounties from
any hostile NPCs you destroy along the way.

### How

If you decide to pursue mission running as a source of income, you'll
want to build up standing with a particular NPC corporation in order
to get access to higher tiers of mission agents (which can then give
you harder missions with better rewards).  Training the skills `Social`
and `Connections` will grant you quicker access to higher-level missions.

In order to tackle these harder missions you'll also want to continue
upgrading to larger classes of ships such as cruisers and battlecruisers.
In general, you'll want:

 * Frigates/destroyers for Level 1 missions
 * Destroyers/cruisers for Level 2 missions
 * Cruisers/battlecruisers for Level 3 missions
 * A well-fit battleship for Level 4 missions

Under the old alpha clone rules the only battlecruiser that alpha clones could use was the `Gnosis`. however, since December 2017 (EVE Vegas) alpha clones can now fly up to a battleship.

You can read more on the [UniWiki 'Missions' page](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missions).

Once you've received a mission from an agent, you can look it up in the
[EVE-Survival](http://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports)
mission listings to get more details about what kind of dps you might face
from enemies in the mission and which enemies may trigger more spawns.

{{% notice warning %}}
Killing ships of the four major empires will often net you large penalties to [faction 
standings](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Faction_Standings) with them.
If those standings get very low (below -5.0), you will be shot on sight in their space.
For that reason, it is recommended to decline missions that send you to fight the 
four major empires (Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar).

You can see the icon for the type of enemies the mission will send you to fight in the Mission Objectives.
You can decline one mission per four hours from a given agent without penalty, 
and receive a new one in its place; declining frequently will carry a standings penalty
with the mission issuer.  If you need to decline more frequently, consider
finding another nearby agent and doing missions for them while you wait.

### Why

Mission running produces a fairly steady stream of ISK - the mission rewards
will pay out a certain amount, plus you'll also be paid the bounties for any
hostile NPCs you killed.

You'll also be rewarded with loyalty points (LP) for the NPC corporation that
is giving you the missions. These LP can be traded for items from the NPC corp's
Loyalty Point Store.
