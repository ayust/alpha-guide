### What

Buy low, sell high. EVE's economy is almost entirely player driven which means
that there are plenty of ways to make money just by playing the market.

### How

There are two main types of trading: station trading and region trading.

Station trading involves placing buy orders and sell orders in a station to arbitrage the
gap between the current highest buy price and the current lowest sell price: players sell
goods to your buy order, then you list the same goods for a higher price as a sell order.
You pocket the difference between the two prices in return for running the risk that you
might not be able to sell something for as good a price as you bought it.

Region trading involves buying goods from a market in one region of the galaxy, then
moving those goods to another region and selling them there. Because buying items from
the market doesn't automatically move them to a player's current station, players will
often pay extra for goods closer to their current location. Prices will also often vary
between market hubs as supply and demand rise and fall between regions. An astute trader
can take advantage of these varying prices to make ISK.

You can read more about trading in the [UniWiki 'Trading' article](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trading).

### Why

Some people really enjoy the careful planning and execution that goes into successful
trading. Traders can also make large amounts of money if they're good at figuring out
trends and staying ahead of the curve.
