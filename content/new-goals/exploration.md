### What

Exploration involves using probes to scan down signatures to find relic
and data sites, and then hacking the containers in those sites to obtain
valuable loot. You can also find wormholes which connect to systems that
are completely unreachable via normal stargates.

### How

Relic sites are the best source of reliable income from exploration - data
sites tend to have fewer valuable items, though occasionally you may find
a very valuable item such as a rare blueprint.

If you choose to pursue exploration, you'll want to use a ship with scanning
and hacking bonuses, like the exploration frigates from each faction.

The best relic sites are found in either nullsec or wormhole space, both of
which are relatively dangerous areas of space but the potential payoff is large.

You can read more about exploration in the [UniWiki 'Exploration' article]
(http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration), and more about wormholes in the
[UniWiki 'Wormholes' article](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes).
If exploring in dangerous space, you may also want to read up on how to
[create safespot bookmarks](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Bookmarks#Safe_Spots)
and use your [directional scanner](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional_Scanner_Guide).

If you're having trouble with the scanning interface,
try looking through our [scanning guide](/reference/scanning/).

{{% notice info %}}
You will notice that many exploration guides mention cloaking devices. Alpha
clones aren't able to use cloaking devices, which means you will be a bit more
vulnerable to attack. You'll need to pay attention to your surroundings
to avoid getting ganked while scanning and hacking.

### Why

Exploration can be an excellent source of income, particularly if you're willing
to brave the riskier areas of space such as nullsec and wormhole space. It's also
very good income relative to the amount of training required, as even a new pilot
with basic scanning and hacking skills in a t1 frigate can potentially get the
same loot as a high-skilled pilot.
