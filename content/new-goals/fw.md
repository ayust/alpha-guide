### What

Faction Warfare involves PvP in the faction-contested lowsec regions. The four
factions gain and lose territory as they fight, and participants earn rewards
based on their efforts to help conquer territory for their faction.

### How

If faction warfare PvP sounds interesting to you, read more about it
in the [UniWiki 'Faction Warfare'](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Factional_Warfare)
and [UniWiki 'FW strategy and tactics'](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Factional_Warfare_strategy_and_tactics)
guides.

### Why

Faction Warfare can be a great way to find semi-structured PvP objectives
with potential rewards. Because faction warfare sites have restrictions on
what classes of ships can enter them, you have the option of fighting with
only smaller classes of ships that are often cheaper to fit - which means
you can fit (and lose) more of them as necessary.

Faction Warfare rewards involve significant amounts of Loyalty Points (LP)
which can be exchanged for military faction equipment, either to use yourself
or sell on the market for ISK.
