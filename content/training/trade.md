If you've chosen a path that involves lots of buying and selling things on
the market, you'll want to improve your trading skills. You can skip these
skills if chosing a path that doesn't focus on the market.

`Trade` Level III will maximize the number of simultaneous buy and sell orders
you can have posted on the market at once as an alpha clone.

`Broker Relations` Level II will slightly reduce the fees involved in creating
market orders. It's a small difference, but over time that can add up to a lot
of ISK.
