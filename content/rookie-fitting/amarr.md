### Weapons

Since rookie ships are frigates, they use weapons from the 'small' size bracket.
This fit uses two `Gatling Pulse Laser I` turrets in the high slots.
Pulse lasers are shorter ranged but easier to fit than beam lasers.
Because you're generally going to be fighting things at close range
in a rookie ship, using a shorter-ranged weapon system is fine.

The pulse lasers are each loaded with a single `Multifrequency S` crystal.
These basic crystals will never burn out, so all you need to buy is two.
Multifrequency is the shortest-ranged basic crystal, but does the most damage.
Since you're going to be fighting a close range anyway, more damage is good.

The reusable `Acolyte I` combat drone can be launched to fly independently to distant enemies,
dealing EM damage to them.  Remember to order your drone to return to your
Drone Bay before warping, or if it is taking damage from enemy fire.

{{% notice info %}}
To use the combat drone, you will need to train the skills `Drones` III and `Light Drone Operation` I.
We recommend you use some of the skill points from the Mini Skill Injector
given in the tutorial to train these skills, as they will be useful in many ships.
You will need to purchase a skillbook from the Market to learn Light Drone Operation.

### Defenses

Since the Impairor is bonused for armor resistances, this fit is designed around armor.
It uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots. It also fits a `Damage Control I`
which increases the ship's resistances, reducing incoming damage and making the armor repairer
more effective.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and also makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your lasers apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

### Where do I get this stuff?

You may already have some of these modules, but if you don't, it's time to go use the Market.
The next chapter will walk you through how to effectively use the market to purchase items.
