### Weapons

Rookie ships (corvettes) use weapons from the 'small' size bracket.
This fit uses two `75mm Gatling Rail I` turrets in the high slots.
Railguns are a long-ranged weapon system, relative to Blasters, the short-ranged hybrid-gun option.
While they pack a bit less punch, the Railguns let you engage sooner,
without spending as much time flying into range while taking enemy fire.

Unlike civilian guns, these - and most other weapons - have to be loaded with ammunition to function.
The railguns are loaded with `Antimatter Charge S` rounds.
You should carry at least 1000 rounds with you.
They are the shortest-range hybrid ammunition, but inflict the most damage. 

When used in combination with the long-range railguns, they allow you to fight effectively at medium range.
You will usually want to command your ship to orbit at about 2500m from your target.
Being too near or too far from a moving target may cause your shots to miss.

The reusable `Hobgoblin I` combat drones can be launched to fly independently to distant enemies,
dealing Thermal damage to them.  Remember to order your drones to return to your
Drone Bay before warping, or if they are taking damage from enemy fire.

To use the combat drone, you will need to train the skills `Drones` III and `Light Drone Operation` I.
We recommend you use some of the skill points from the Mini Skill Injector
given in the tutorial to train these skills, as they will be useful in many ships.
You will need to purchase a skillbook from the Market to learn Light Drone Operation.

### Defenses

Since the Velator is bonused for armor repairs, this fit is designed around armor.
It uses a `Small Armor Repairer I` in one of the low slots. It also fits a `Damage Control I`
which increases the ship's resistances, reducing incoming damage and making the armor repairer
more effective.

### Utility

The `1MN Afterburner I` provides your ship with additional speed. This both makes it easier to
catch enemy ships and makes your ship harder to hit.

The `Stasis Webifier I` helps your railguns apply their damage better, because it's easier to hit
the slower targets. (It also makes it easier to stay in range of the slower enemies.)

### Where do I get this stuff?

You may already have some of these modules, but if you don't, it's time to go use the Market.
The next chapter will walk you through how to effectively use the market to purchase items.
