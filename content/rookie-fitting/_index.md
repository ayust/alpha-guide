Now that you're done with the tutorial (and probably just got your ship blown up),
you might be wondering what to do next.

Don't panic!

The easiest ship to get your hands on is your own race's corvette (typically known as a "rookie ship"). You can get one for free by clicking the "Board my Corvette" button while docked in a station or citadel.

You can significantly improve the effectiveness of your rookie ship by properly fitting
it with modules bought from the market. Select your race below to see a suggested fit
for your racial rookie ship that you can use without having to train more skills.
